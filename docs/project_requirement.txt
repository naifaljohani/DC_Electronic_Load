The final project is to be a USB controlled Electronic DC load, with the following features:
1. Current range of "5A -15mA".( to be verified)
2. Voltage range of "50V-1mV".( to be verified)
3. Connecting to a USB port as a serial device.
4. Controlled via an application GUI throw the serial port.
5. Powered via USB. (to be verified)
6. Has the four basic modes: CC, CV, CR, and CW.
7. Data logging in any mode.
8. External triggering.
9. Output functions, initially square wave.

Communications of data internally between functions and externally:
1. Static 
a. Average rate
b. Maximum rate 
c. Peak rate 
2. Dynamic(FIFO):
a. Average rate
b. Maximum rate 
c. Peak rate 

Timing:
1. Total execution time of the main function.
2. Rate of execution with a tolerance of ….+-. (to be added to the function list)
3. Response time with a tolerance of ….+- .  (to be added to the function list)
